# Code for ["Connecting direct and indirect detection with a dark spike in the cosmic-ray electron spectrum"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07177)

Code author: Adam Coogan

## Summary
The DAMPE satellite recently detected an excess of high-energy electrons and positrons. In our paper, we study whether a nearby clump of dark matter could explain this observation, requiring it to be consistent with other astrophysical observations. We also assess its compatibility with dark matter simulations. Such a clump would have to be very nearby, and could contribute significantly to the dark matter density in the Solar System.
